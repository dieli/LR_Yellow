# LR_Yellow
Small plugin for Lightroom, based on the ftp upload plugin from Adobe for Yellow CMS.

The plugin adds a few fields to the ftp export dialog provided by Adobe, in order to
upload selected pictures to a specific folder on the ftp and create a new blog entry
for the uploaded images (as gallery). Currently this is tested with latest Lightroom CC
and the Yellow Photoswipe + Blog plugin.

How do I install this?
----------------------
1. Download the [plugin](https://github.com/dieli/LR_Yellow/archive/master.zip) .  
2. Extract the 'ftp_upload.lrdevplugin' folder to your harddrive
3. Inside Lightroom go to the plugin manager, click add and navigate to the 'ftp_upload.lrdevplugin' folder

How to use the gallery?
------------------
Select some images in Lightroom and go to export. Select FTP Upload and ![Export Dialog](dialog.png?raw=true)
should appear.

How to configure the gallery?
------------------------
Hmmm ...
